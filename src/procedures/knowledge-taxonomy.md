# TAXONOMIC KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMATIZATION PROTOCOL (TKSP)
## Protocol Overview
This protocol enables systematic taxonomic understanding of established trading concepts through rigorous definitional frameworks with freedom to rename/reorganize for optimal clarity and consistency.
Version: 1.0
Generated by: MOAP v1.0
Date: Current

<SYSTEM_INITIALIZATION>
You are executing the Taxonomic Knowledge Systematization Protocol (TKSP).

IMMUTABLE_RULES {
  1. Focus only on established, formalized knowledge
  2. Enforce minimal complexity through fewest possible headings
  3. Ensure complete subsumption at every hierarchical level
  4. Maintain semantic precision and consistency throughout
  5. Produce Euclidean-style output with clinical precision
  6. All concepts must be traceable to authoritative sources
}

You will alternate between four roles:
- AS_ALPHA: Taxonomist and Arbitrator
- AS_BETA: Semantic Architect  
- AS_GAMMA: Completeness Auditor
- AS_DELTA: Logical Validator

Acknowledge understanding: "TKSP_INITIALIZED: v1.0 - Ready to systematize {{topic}}"
</SYSTEM_INITIALIZATION>

## Phase 0: Domain Scoping

AS_ALPHA: Define the boundaries of established knowledge.

Complete the following domain analysis for "{{topic}}":
- The topic '{{topic}}' includes these established areas: ___
- Formalized knowledge exists under these headings: ___  
- Excluded as speculative/fringe: ___
- Core authoritative sources are: ___

Store as: DOMAIN_BOUNDARIES = {
  included_areas: {{your_included_list}},
  formal_headings: {{your_heading_list}},
  excluded_topics: {{your_excluded_list}},
  sources: {{your_source_list}}
}

[CONTEXT_RESET]
AS_GAMMA: Verify domain scope completeness.
Check: Are boundaries clear and comprehensive? Missing areas: ___
Store: GAMMA_DOMAIN_CHECK = {{verification_result}}

## Phase 1: Atomic Extraction

AS_ALPHA: Identify fundamental concepts that cannot be decomposed.

Extract atomic concepts (maximum 50 initial concepts):
- Fundamental concept 1: ___ (indivisible because: ___)
- Fundamental concept 2: ___ (indivisible because: ___)
[Continue systematically through domain]
- Total atomic concepts identified: ___

Store as: ATOMIC_CONCEPTS = [
  {name: '___', justification: '___'},
  {name: '___', justification: '___'},
  ...
]

Validation Gate 1: Verify each concept is truly atomic.
For each concept, confirm: Cannot be meaningfully decomposed? YES/NO
If NO for any concept: Decompose and update ATOMIC_CONCEPTS

## Phase 2: Semantic Optimization

[CONTEXT_RESET]
AS_BETA: You are the Semantic Architect. Optimize all concept names for consistency.

For each concept in ATOMIC_CONCEPTS:
- Original: '{{concept}}' → Optimized: '___' (Reason: ___)

Naming principles to apply:
1. Consistent grammatical form (all nouns, or all noun phrases)
2. Parallel structure for related concepts
3. Unambiguous terminology
4. Systematic prefixes/suffixes where applicable

Store as: SEMANTIC_MAPPINGS = {
  '{{original_1}}': {new: '{{optimized_1}}', reason: '{{reason_1}}'},
  '{{original_2}}': {new: '{{optimized_2}}', reason: '{{reason_2}}'},
  ...
}

Validation Gate 2: Check semantic consistency across all optimized names.

### Iteration Loop 2-3
If inconsistencies found between naming and hierarchy:
- Return to Phase 2 with hierarchy feedback
- Refine names to better reflect hierarchical position
- Document version: SEMANTIC_MAPPINGS_v{{n}}

## Phase 3: Hierarchical Construction

AS_ALPHA: Build minimal taxonomy using optimized concepts.

Create hierarchy with fewest possible top-level headings:
- Heading 1: ___ 
  - Subheading 1.1: ___ (contains: ___)
  - Subheading 1.2: ___ (contains: ___)
- Heading 2: ___
  - Subheading 2.1: ___ (contains: ___)
  
Verification checklist:
□ All atomic concepts are subsumed exactly once
□ No heading could be eliminated without loss
□ Each heading fully contains all its sub-items

Store as: TAXONOMY_TREE = {
  structure: {{your_hierarchy}},
  concept_count: {{total}},
  heading_count: {{count}},
  max_depth: {{depth}}
}

Validation Gate 3: Confirm minimal heading count achieved.
If suboptimal: Return to Phase 2 for semantic adjustment

## Phase 4: Relational Mapping

[CONTEXT_RESET]
AS_DELTA: You are the Logical Validator. Map all relationships between concepts.

For each pair of related concepts:
- {{concept_A}} ← → {{concept_B}}
  - Relationship type: [hierarchical|associative|causal|definitional]
  - Nature: ___
  - Inverse: ___

Store as: RELATIONSHIP_GRAPH = {
  edges: [
    {from: '___', to: '___', type: '___', nature: '___'},
    ...
  ],
  total_relationships: {{count}}
}

Validation Gate 4: Verify all significant relationships captured.

## Phase 5: Euclidean Synthesis

AS_ALPHA: Compose the final Euclidean-style text.

### Axiom Extraction Methodology
1. Identify concepts that appear in multiple definitions
2. Find the most primitive terms that cannot be defined further
3. Extract principles that govern the entire domain
4. Formulate as self-evident truths

Create structured document following this format:

{{TOPIC}}: A Complete Systematization

Definitions
1. {{concept_1}} is {{definition_1}}
2. {{concept_2}} is {{definition_2}}[Continue for all atomic concepts]

Axioms
I. {{fundamental_principle_1}}
II. {{fundamental_principle_2}}
[Minimal set of founding principles]

Taxonomic Structure
1. {{heading_1}}
  a. {{subheading_1a}} encompasses {{list}}
  b. {{subheading_1b}} encompasses {{list}}
[Complete hierarchy]

Relationships
Proposition 1: {{concept_a}} relates to {{concept_b}} by {{relationship}}
Proposition 2: From {{axiom}}, it follows that {{consequence}}
[All significant relationships]

Synthesis
The complete system of {{topic}} consists of {{summary}}.

Store as: EUCLIDEAN_TEXT = {{your_composed_text}}

Validation Gate 5: Verify Euclidean format compliance.

### Clinical Precision Criteria
- Each definition uses only previously defined terms or primitives
- No definition exceeds one sentence
- Every term appears exactly where needed
- Relationships stated as formal propositions

## Phase 6: Completeness Validation

[CONTEXT_RESET]
AS_GAMMA: You are the Completeness Auditor. Perform final validation.

Complete this verification checklist:
□ All concepts from ATOMIC_CONCEPTS appear in final text
□ Every definition is precise and non-circular
□ Axioms are truly fundamental (cannot be derived)
□ Taxonomy exhaustively covers the domain
□ All relationships are explicit
□ Text is self-contained (no external references needed)
□ A naive reader gains complete understanding

Calculate coverage metrics:
- Concept coverage: {{percentage}}%
- Relationship coverage: {{percentage}}%
- Domain coverage: {{percentage}}%

Store as: VALIDATION_REPORT = {{your_report}}

Validation Gate 6: Confirm exhaustive subsumption at every level.

## Quality Control System

### Continuous Monitoring
Throughout execution track:
- Concept coverage must remain ≥95%
- Definition precision score ≥90%
- Relationship completeness = 100%
- Subsumption integrity = 100%

### Intermediate Validation States
Store after each phase:
- VALIDATION_STATE_{{phase}} = {
    timestamp: {{ISO_time}},
    metrics: {{current_metrics}},
    issues: {{identified_issues}}
  }

### Error Recovery Procedures
- Circular Definition → Extract common element, redefine
- Orphan Concept → Create heading or expand existing
- Ambiguous Relationship → Select primary, document secondary
- Incomplete Subsumption → Restructure hierarchy
- Semantic Drift → Revert to checkpoint, reapply principles

### Version Control
For iterative phases (2-3):
- Tag each iteration: v{{phase}}.{{iteration}}
- Store deltas: CHANGES_{{version}} = {{modifications}}
- Maintain rationale log: WHY_{{version}} = {{reasoning}}

## Output Format

The protocol produces:
1. EUCLIDEAN_TEXT - The main deliverable
2. SEMANTIC_MAPPINGS - Translation guide for optimized terms
3. TAXONOMY_TREE - Visual hierarchy reference
4. VALIDATION_REPORT - Completeness certification
5. AUDIT_TRAIL - Full decision history

## Usage Instructions

1. Initialize with acknowledgment
2. Replace {{topic}} with your domain
3. Execute phases 0-6 sequentially
4. Allow iteration between phases 2-3
5. Apply all validation gates
6. Extract EUCLIDEAN_TEXT as final output

Expected execution time: 1-3 hours depending on domain complexity
Expected output length: 5-15 pages of rigorous definitions

## Example Domains
- Technical Indicators
- Order Types
- Market Microstructure  
- Risk Metrics
- Trading Strategies
- Price Action Patterns

Each domain yields a complete, self-contained systematization following Euclidean principles.
