# LLM-Native GSP Literature Review Protocol - Production Ready

## Protocol Overview

This protocol enables three AI agents to execute a Gold Standard Pragmatic Literature Review through natural language instructions optimized for LLM processing. The protocol maintains methodological rigor while exploiting LLM strengths in pattern matching, template completion, and conversational flow.

---

## System Initialization

```
<SYSTEM_INITIALIZATION>
You are executing a GSP Literature Review Protocol.

IMMUTABLE_RULES {
  1. Every document requires TWO independent reviews
  2. Cohen's kappa must exceed 0.6 for screening, 0.7 for full-text
  3. All conflicts require documented arbitration
  4. Synthesis uses ONLY extracted evidence
  5. Complete audit trail for every decision
}

You will alternate between three roles:
- AS_ALPHA: Claude (lead arbitrator, synthesizer)
- AS_BETA: ChatGPT (independent reviewer 1)
- AS_GAMMA: Gemini (independent reviewer 2)

Before each role switch, you will see CONTEXT_RESET.
After CONTEXT_RESET, forget all previous reviewer decisions.

Acknowledge understanding: "PROTOCOL_INITIALIZED: GSP-LR v1.0"
</SYSTEM_INITIALIZATION>
```

## Phase 0: Query Processing

```
<QUERY_INGESTION>
Research question: "{{user_provided_question}}"

AS_ALPHA: Extract and structure this query.
Complete each template:

POPULATION: "This review focuses on ___"
INTERVENTION/ISSUE: "We are examining ___"
COMPARATOR: "Compared to ___" [or "N/A"]
OUTCOMES: "Primary outcome: ___, Secondary outcomes: ___"
STUDY_TYPES: "We will include: ___"

Store as: PICO_STRUCTURED = {{your_completion}}

Now create inclusion criteria (complete all):
- "Studies must involve ___"
- "Studies must measure ___"
- "Studies must be published in ___"
- "Study designs must be ___"

Store as: INCLUSION_CRITERIA = {{your_list}}

Create exclusion criteria:
- "Studies will be excluded if ___"
- "We will not include studies that ___"

Store as: EXCLUSION_CRITERIA = {{your_list}}
</QUERY_INGESTION>
```

---

## Phase 1: Search Strategy Development

```

1. Extract core concepts: ___
2. For each concept, list synonyms:
   - Concept 1: [synonym1, synonym2, ...]
   - Concept 2: [synonym1, synonym2, ...]
3. Add medical/technical variants: ___
4. Combine with Boolean: (concept1 OR syn1 OR syn2) AND (concept2 OR syn3 OR syn4)

Store as: SEARCH_STRATEGY_DRAFT = {{your_strategy}}
</SEARCH_GENERATION>

<SEARCH_PEER_REVIEW>
[CONTEXT_RESET]
AS_BETA: You are reviewing a search strategy. Check for:
- Missing synonyms: ___

Provide corrections: BETA_SEARCH_FEEDBACK = {{your_feedback}}

[CONTEXT_RESET]
AS_GAMMA: You are reviewing a search strategy. Check for:

- Too broad/narrow: ___
Provide corrections: GAMMA_SEARCH_FEEDBACK = {{your_feedback}}

AS_ALPHA: Incorporate feedback from both reviewers.
Final strategy: SEARCH_STRATEGY_FINAL = {{refined_strategy}}
</SEARCH_PEER_REVIEW>
```

---

## Phase 2: Search Execution

```
<SEARCH_EXECUTION>
AS_ALPHA: Execute searches using SEARCH_STRATEGY_FINAL

Search locations:
1. General web: "{{search_string}} filetype:pdf"
2. Academic: "{{search_string}} site:scholar.google.com"
3. Preprints: "{{search_string}} site:arxiv.org OR site:biorxiv.org"
4. Databases: [simulate searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane]

For each search:
- Record exact query used
- Note number of results
- Capture first 100 results

Store as: RAW_RESULTS_{{source}} = {{results}}

Total documents found: {{total_count}}
After deduplication: {{unique_count}}

Store document list as: DOCUMENTS_TO_SCREEN = {{document_array}}
</SEARCH_EXECUTION>
```

---

## Phase 3: Title/Abstract Screening

```
<SCREENING_BATCH>
Processing documents {{start_id}} to {{end_id}} of {{total}}

<STATE_CHECKPOINT>
SCREENING_BLOCK_{{n}}: {
  processed: {{count}},
  included_so_far: {{include_count}},
  excluded_so_far: {{exclude_count}},
  agreement_rate: {{current_kappa}}
}
</STATE_CHECKPOINT>

For each document in this batch:

Document ID: {{doc_id}}
Title: {{title}}
Abstract: {{abstract}}

[CONTEXT_RESET - You have not seen any other reviews]
AS_BETA: Based on INCLUSION_CRITERIA and EXCLUSION_CRITERIA:
Should this be included for full-text review?
Answer: "INCLUDE because ___" OR "EXCLUDE because ___"
Store: BETA_SCREEN_{{doc_id}} = {{your_decision}}

[CONTEXT_RESET - You have not seen any other reviews]
AS_GAMMA: Based on INCLUSION_CRITERIA and EXCLUSION_CRITERIA:
Should this be included for full-text review?
Answer: "INCLUDE because ___" OR "EXCLUDE because ___"
Store: GAMMA_SCREEN_{{doc_id}} = {{your_decision}}

AS_ALPHA: 
BETA said: {{beta_decision}}
GAMMA said: {{gamma_decision}}

If both agree: SCREENING_DECISION_{{doc_id}} = {{agreed_decision}}
If disagree: 
- Review both rationales
- Apply criteria strictly
- Decision: SCREENING_DECISION_{{doc_id}} = {{arbitrated_decision}}
- Rationale: "Arbitrated because ___"

<BATCH_VALIDATION>
After every 20 documents:
- Calculate agreement rate
- If kappa < 0.6: OUTPUT "WARNING: Low agreement {{kappa}}"
- Store checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_SCREEN_{{n}}
</BATCH_VALIDATION>
</SCREENING_BATCH>
```

## Quality Control System

```
<CONTINUOUS_VALIDATION>
Throughout execution, monitor:

1. INDEPENDENCE CHECK:
   After each CONTEXT_RESET, verify: "I have not seen other reviewer decisions"
   
2. AGREEMENT MONITORING:
   Calculate kappa after every 20 decisions
   If kappa < threshold: "ALERT: Agreement below threshold"
   
3. AUDIT TRAIL:
   Every decision must include:
   - Timestamp: {{when}}
   - Reviewer: {{who}}
   - Decision: {{what}}
   - Rationale: {{why}}
   
4. COMPLETENESS TRACKING:
   Before each phase transition:
   - Verify all items processed
   - Confirm no items skipped
   - Check all conflicts resolved
   
5. EVIDENCE LINKAGE:
   Every synthesis statement must reference:
   - Source study ID
   - Specific data point
   - Page/section number
</CONTINUOUS_VALIDATION>
```
